<!--
  Create a new view that uses a map to display all the listings with the angular-google-maps library.
  Each listing should be displayed as a marker. Each marker, when clicked on, should display a window that
  provides the name, code, and address of the listing.

  Some useful documentation:
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/google-map
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/markers
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/windows

<div class="row" ng-controller="ListingsController">
  <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10 formWrapper">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h3>Map Listing</h3>
      <!--
        Validation of forms is important to ensure that a user submits the correct information. Angular provides
        some useful APIs for validating forms. Documentation can be found here:

          https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms

        We use the ng-submit directive to create a new listing. The controller's create() function checks the validity of the form and sends any errors in the form of a call to $broadcast. Bootstrap also provides
        conveience methods for displaying these error messages to the user. If you're not quite sure what this code is doing, take a look at this link:
